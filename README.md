# unifi-armv7hf-docker
Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) UniFi Controller for Ubuntu Linux Docker Container running on ARMV7HF architecture

This [docker](http://www.docker.com) container is currently work in progress and my docker learning curve is still very steep.
So I am very open to patches and pull requests.
The plan is to be able to deploy this container on a [QNAP TS-1635](https://www.qnap.com/de-de/product/model.php?II=247) without any extra work.
